abstract = {Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene is the predominant method to quantify microbial compositions and to discover novel lineages. However, traditional short amplicons often do not contain enough information to confidently resolve their phylogeny. Here we present a cost-effective protocol that amplifies a large part of the rRNA operon and sequences the amplicons with PacBio technology. We tested our method on a mock community and developed a read-curation pipeline that reduces the overall read error rate to 0.18{\%}. Applying our method on four environmental samples, we captured near full-length rRNA operon amplicons from a large diversity of prokaryotes. The method operated at moderately high-throughput (22286–37,850 raw ccs reads) and generated a large amount of putative novel archaeal 23S rRNA gene sequences compared to the archaeal SILVA database. These long amplicons allowed for higher resolution during taxonomic classification by means of long (∼1000 bp) 16S rRNA gene fragments and for substantially more confident phylogenies by means of combined near full-length 16S and 23S rRNA gene sequences, compared to shorter traditional amplicons (250 bp of the 16S rRNA gene). We recommend our method to those who wish to cost-effectively and confidently estimate the phylogenetic diversity of prokaryotes in environmental samples at high throughput.},

abstract = {DNA-based monitoring of microbial communities that are responsible for the performance of anaerobic digestion of sewage wastes has the potential to improve resource recoveries for wastewater treatment facilities. By treating sludge with propidium monoazide (PMA) prior to amplicon sequencing, this study explored how the presence of DNA from dead microbial biomass carried over with feed sludge may mislead process-relevant biomarkers, and whether primer choice impacts such assessments. Four common primers were selected for amplicon preparation, also to determine if universal primers have sufficient taxonomic or functional coverage for monitoring ecological performance; or whether two domain-specific primers for Bacteria and Archaea are necessary. Anaerobic sludges of three municipal continuously stirred-tank reactors in Victoria, Australia, were sampled at one time-point. A total of 240 amplicon libraries were sequenced on a Miseq using two universal and two domain-specific primer pairs. Untargeted metabolomics was chosen to complement biological interpretation of amplicon gene-based functional predictions. Diversity, taxonomy, phylogeny and functional potentials were systematically assessed using PICRUSt2, which can predict community wide pathway abundance. The two chosen universal primers provided similar diversity profiles of abundant Bacteria and Archaea, compared to the domain-specific primers. About 16 {\%} of all detected prokaryotic genera covering 30 {\%} of total abundances and 6 {\%} of PICRUSt2-estimated pathway abundances were affected by PMA. This showed that dead biomass in the anaerobic digesters impacted DNA-based assessments, with implications for predicting active processes, such as methanogenesis, denitrification or the identification of organisms associated with biological foams. Hence, instead of running two sequencing runs with two different domain-specific primers, we propose conducting PMA-seq with universal primer pairs for routine performance monitoring. However, dead sludge biomass may have some predictive value. In principal component analysis the compositional variation of 239 sludge metabolites resembled that of 'dead-plus-alive' biomass, suggesting that dead organisms contributed to the potentially process-relevant sludge metabolome.},

abstract = {Reductions in sequencing costs have enabled widespread use of shotgun metagenomics and amplicon sequencing, which have drastically improved our understanding of the microbial world. However, large sequencing projects are now hampered by the cost of library preparation and low sample throughput, comparatively to the actual sequencing costs. Here, we benchmarked three high-throughput DNA extraction methods: ZymoBIOMICS™ 96 MagBead DNA Kit, MP BiomedicalsTM FastDNATM-96 Soil Microbe DNA Kit, and DNeasy{\textregistered} 96 PowerSoil{\textregistered} Pro QIAcube{\textregistered} HT Kit. The DNA extractions were evaluated based on length, quality, quantity, and the observed microbial community across five diverse soil types. DNA extraction of all soil types was successful for all kits, however DNeasy{\textregistered} 96 PowerSoil{\textregistered} Pro QIAcube{\textregistered} HT Kit excelled across all performance parameters. We further used the nanoliter dispensing system I.DOT One to miniaturize Illumina amplicon and metagenomic library preparation volumes by a factor of 5 and 10, respectively, with no significant impact on the observed microbial communities. With these protocols, DNA extraction, metagenomic, or amplicon library preparation for one 96-well plate are approx. 3, 5, and 6 hours, respectively. Furthermore, the miniaturization of amplicon and metagenome library preparation reduces the chemical and plastic costs from 5.0 to 3.6 and 59 to 7.3 USD pr. sample. This enhanced efficiency and cost-effectiveness will enable researchers to undertake studies with greater sample sizes and diversity, thereby providing a richer, more detailed view of microbial communities and their dynamics.},
