This GitBook provides a basic step-by-step protocol for students who want to get started with sequencing multiple samples of high quality, full-length microbial amplicons with an Oxford Nanopore instrument, and then process and visualise the data using various packages in R. This protocol reflects the experiences we had in the lab and may help to get you started on your own journey of discovery. One of the biggest hurdles for students that embark on sequencing environmental DNA for the first time, is the effort required to learn new technologies, various coding languages, file types and formats, packages or platforms that are involved (think Unix, Linux, Slurm, Qiime, R, RMarkdown, python, conda, ggplot, docker, GitHub, data instances…) before they even can start looking at exploring the data for biological meaning and producing publishable output. Hence, this protocol aims at lowering your ‘activation’ energy by providing some guidance for each step from DNA extraction, to amplification, library preparation, sequencing, data processing and finally some basic visualisations in R. This protocol uses the DNeasy Powersoil Pro Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to extract DNA from wastewater sludge, as well as the Native Barcoding Kit (SQK-NBD114.96) with a R10.4.1 flowcell (FLO-MIN114) to sequence long (~4-4.4 kb) amplicons from environmental DNA. The primer used was developed by (Martijn et al. 2019). Initial costs to purchase all consumables will be ~AUD$7,700. Check out our workflows for short-read 16S sequencing at https://chrismitbiz.github.io/ABlab-workflows if you want to get started with Miseq 16S sequencing instead. If you are interested in sequencing the living biomass via PMA treatment in combination with short-read 16S sequencing, check out our recent paper Dead in the water – Role of relic DNA and primer choice for targeted sequencing surveys of anaerobic sewage sludge intended for biological monitoring (Krohn et al. 2024) Get in touch We work at the Andy Ball lab, RMIT University, Bundoora, Melbourne and are part of the Industry-led Biosolids Training Centre.

In 2021 I joined the ARC Biosolids Training Centre at RMIT (www.transformingbiosolids.org.au), where we help water utilities to improve circular resource management by getting more renewable biogas and carbon/fertiliser values out of our municipal biosolids (essentially our poo). In project 1C of the Centre I develop metagenomic (DNA-based) methods to monitor the microbiome of anaerobic digestion, an important microbial treatment process for wastewater. I believe DNA-based diagnoses of wastewater sludges will help the water/biosolids sector improve resource recoveries and risk management. Before that, after a career in one of the most fast-cycled and short-sighted manufacturing industries that took me from Germany to Vietnam and Hong Kong/Shenzhen, I decided to hit the switch and start thinking long-term and circular. Ten back-to-uni years later, in 2021 I finished a PhD in Soil Science at La Trobe Uni where I sequenced soil DNA and explored if and how soil biology was involved in the degradation of extremely persistent legacy pesticides that contaminate agricultural surface soils since several decades.

Knowledge in shell scripting and Linux syntax. 2.2 DNA extraction kit We commonly extract DNA from soils or from wastewater sludges using the DNeasy Powersoil Pro Kit (Qiagen) for both, soil and sludge. It resulted in high quality DNA, suitable for library preparation and sequencing. Extraction with this kit includes a bead beating step to release DNA from cells out of difficult matrices such as soils and sludge (biofilms) or similar. The sheared DNA will be fragmented with a N50 of ~7 kb in some cases (Jensen et al. 2024). Shearing of DNA may be minimised by reducing/optimising bead-beating duration and speed. Other commonly used and commercially available kits for DNA extraction are available (Jensen et al. 2024; Gand et al. 2023). “Example of read size distribution of sludge DNA extracted with the DNeasy Powersoil Pro Kit in our lab” 2.3 Consumables Native Barcoding Kit (Oxford Nanopore, SQK-NBD114.96) R10.4.1 flowcell (Oxford Nanopore, FLO-MIN114) NEBNext Quick Ligation Module (E6056, New England Biolab) NEBNext Ultra II End repair/dA-tailing Module (E7546S, New England Biolab) Blunt/TA Ligase Master Mix (M0367, New England Biolab) 10 mM dNTPs (N0447S, New England Biolab) Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (M0493, New England Biolab) DNeasy Powersoil Pro Kit (#47016, Qiagen) Qubit 1X dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Q33266, Thermo Fisher) Eppendorf LoBind tubes (Eppendorf) twin.tec® PCR plate 96 LoBind, semi skirted (0030129504, Eppendorf) JetSeq Clean Magnetic beads (MER-BIO-68031, Millenium Science) - to clean up PCR products 10 µM Forward Primer A519F (CAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) (Martijn et al. 2019) 10 µM Reverse Primer U2428R (CCRAMCTGTCTCACGACG) (Martijn et al. 2019) Nuclease-free water 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 with 50 mM NaCl (UltraPure™ 1M Tris-HCI, pH 8.0 #15568025 &amp; NaCl (5 M), RNase-free #AM9760G, Thermo Fisher) Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) (50 mg/ml) (AM2616, InvitrogenTM UltraPure) HyperLadder 1kb (BIO-33025, Bioline, Millenium Science) 80% ethanol, freshly prepared in nuclease-free water 2.4 Protocols A protocol for PCR amplification and clean-up (included in this Gitbook) ‘Ligation sequencing amplicons - Native Barcoding Kit 96 V14’ available on nanoporetech.com - Checklist and full protocol 2.5 Equipment Nanopore sequencer.
