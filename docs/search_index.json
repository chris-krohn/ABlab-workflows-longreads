This GitBook provides a step-by-step protocol for anyone who want to get started with sequencing multiple samples of high quality, full-length microbial amplicons (16S-ITS-23S) with an Oxford Nanopore instrument, and then process and visualise the data using various packages in R. The aim is to profile a community of bacteria and archaea on species-level. Read and use this protocol either directly or to develop your own. This protocol reflects the experiences we had in the lab and may help to get you started on your own journey of discovery. One of the biggest hurdles is the effort required to learn new technologies, hence this protocol aims at lowering your ‘activation’ energy by providing some guidance for each step from DNA extraction, to amplification, library preparation, sequencing, data processing and finally some basic visualisations in R. This protocol uses the DNeasy Powersoil Pro Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to extract DNA from wastewater sludge, as well as the Native Barcoding Kit (SQK-NBD114.96) with a R10.4.1 flowcell (FLO-MIN114) to sequence long (~4-4.4 kb) amplicons from environmental DNA. The primer used was developed by (Martijn et al. 2019). Initial costs to purchase all consumables will be ~AUD$7,700. Check out our workflows for short-read 16S sequencing at https://chrismitbiz.github.io/ABlab-workflows if you want to get started with Miseq 16S sequencing instead. If you are interested in sequencing the living biomass via PMA treatment in combination with short-read 16S sequencing, check out our recent paper Dead in the water – Role of relic DNA and primer choice for targeted sequencing surveys of anaerobic sewage sludge intended for biological monitoring (Krohn et al. 2024) Get in touch We work at the Andy Ball lab, RMIT University, Bundoora, Melbourne and are part of the Industry-led Biosolids Training Centre.

In 2021 I joined the ARC Biosolids Training Centre at RMIT (www.transformingbiosolids.org.au), where we help water utilities to improve circular resource management by getting more renewable biogas and carbon/fertiliser values out of our municipal biosolids (essentially our poo). In project 1C of the Centre I develop metagenomic (DNA-based) methods to monitor the microbiome of anaerobic digestion, an important microbial treatment process for wastewater. I believe DNA-based diagnoses of wastewater sludges will help the water/biosolids sector improve resource recoveries and risk management. Before that, after a career in one of the most fast-cycled and short-sighted manufacturing industries that took me from Germany to Vietnam and Hong Kong/Shenzhen, I decided to hit the switch and start thinking long-term and circular. Ten back-to-uni years later, in 2021 I finished a PhD in Soil Science at La Trobe Uni where I sequenced soil DNA and explored if and how soil biology was involved in the degradation of extremely persistent legacy pesticides that contaminate agricultural surface soils since several decades.

Knowledge in shell scripting and Linux syntax. 2.2 DNA extraction kit We commonly extract DNA from soils or from wastewater sludges using the DNeasy Powersoil Pro Kit (Qiagen) for both, soil and sludge. It resulted in high quality DNA, suitable for library preparation and sequencing. Extraction with this kit includes a bead beating step to release DNA from cells out of difficult matrices such as soils and sludge (biofilms) or similar. The sheared DNA will be fragmented with a N50 of ~7 kb in some cases (Jensen et al. 2024). Shearing of DNA may be minimised by reducing/optimising bead-beating duration and speed.

Fragmentation of amplicons may lead to incomplete reads. The primer amplifies the whole rrn operon. Benefits of targeting the whole rrn operon: Superior species-level resolution and accuracy (Cuscó et al. 2019; Srinivas et al. 2024). Covers Bacteria and Archaea. Risks of targeting the whole rrn operon: Not as representative of true abundances as full-length 16S amplicons. Species with unlinked 16S and 23S rrn DNA will be missed with this approach (for example &lt; 9% of rRNA genes in wastewater sludge (Brewer et al. 2020)). 3.2.2 PCR Time required: ~4 hrs incl. 2hrs, 40mins PCR. Prepare a PCR mastermix for the required number of 50-µl reactions (Table 3.1). It may be necessary to combine two 50 µl reactions for each sample to produce sufficient amplicon mass for a final concentration of 200 fmol as input for the Native Barcoding Kit from Oxford Nanopore. Add 3 µl of eDNA (5ng /µl) into a 96-well plate (e.g. Eppendorf twin.tec® PCR plate 96 LoBind, semi-skirted) using a multichannel pipette. Add 47 µl of mastermix using a multichannel pipette and carefully pipette up and down 10 x Run thermocycler (Table 3.2). Verify amplification length via 1% agarose gel electrophoresis @ 100V for 30 min including a 1 kb ladder. Store at 4˚C overnight if needed. Important: Use hot start polymerase for ease of use, with high fidelity/accuracy and one that is suitable for long amplicons. For example, Q5 High- Fidelity DNA Polymerase kit (New England Biolabs) with GC enhancer (Martijn et al. 2019). ≤ 200 fmol is required per sample for the Native Barcoding Kit from ONP. Based on 4.25 kb (4-4.5kb), the final DNA concentration after cleaning up PCR products should be no less than 48 ng/µL (at 11.5 µl input volume) - giving 552 ng of 4.25kb amplicons. It may require two PCR reactions to achieve the required DNA amount (200 fmol); e.g. pool 2 x 50µl PCR products, clean combined and elude in 32.5 µl Tris.     Table 3.1: List of components for each reaction (each tube) for PCR.

This follows a similar protocol to the Illumina 16S-metagenomics library prep guide in case you are familiar with that. Time required: ~ 1 hr per 24 samples. 3.3.1 Checklist Magnetic rack for 96-well plate (e.g. #AM10027 Thermo Fisher) 80% ethanol, freshly prepared in nuclease-free water Nuclease-free water 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 with 50 mM NaCl (UltraPure™ 1M Tris-HCI, pH 8.0 #15568025 &amp; NaCl (5 M), RNase-free #AM9760G, Thermo Fisher) JetSeq Clean Magnetic beads (MER-BIO-68031, Millenium Science) or equivalent - to clean up PCR products Qubit 1X dsDNA BR or HR Assay Kit (Q33266 or Q33231, Thermo Fisher) HyperLadder 1kb (BIO-33025, Bioline, Millenium Science) A worksheet to enter concentrations to calculate volumes to normalise DNA to 200 fmol Note Use wide bore tips for adding mag beads and subsequent (careful) mixing by pipetting to minimise DNA fragmentation. 3.3.2 Steps Pool replicate reactions into one well - e.g. 2 x 50 µl = 100 µl in one well. Using a multi-channel pipette, add 0.6X beads to PCR products in the same wells (e.g. 60 µl to 100 µl pooled reactions), pipette 10 x up and down and/or a gentle vortex after sealing the plate, careful not to spill (Vortex Genie speed 2). 10 min incubation at RT Place plate on a magnetic rack for 5 mins and remove supernatant. Wash twice with 200 µl 80% ethanol in same 96-well plate, discard ethanol and let evaporate for ~ 5 mins or until completely removed. Take plate off magnet and elude pellet to a volume that provides appropriate DNA concentrations e.g. add 32.5 µl of elution buffer (10 mM Tris 50mM NaCl). The pellet will be stuck higher than the buffer surface in the well. Hence, pipetting up and down 20–30 x may be necessary to carefully wash the pellet of the tube wall, using a wide bore tip. And/or centrifuge plate at 200 rcf for 1 min. Off-magnet, incubate plate for 15 minutes at 37°C (e.g. in a water bath with only the wells submerged in water). Every 2 minutes, agitate the sample by gently vortexing the plate for 10 seconds (after sealing plate) to encourage DNA elution - and spin plate down. Collect 32 µl of cleaned DNA after ~ 5 mins on magnet using wide bore tips. Quantify and record amplicon concentrations using Qubit HS or BS chemistry and record values. Based on 4 kb amplicons, the final DNA concentration after cleaning up PCR products should be no less than 45 ng/µL to have sufficient material for downstream library preparation (200 fmol, &gt; 520 ng of 4 kb amplicons). Verify amplification length via 0.5-1% agarose gel electrophoresis @ 100V for 30 min including a 1 kb ladder. For each sample calculate volumes required of cleaned DNA and H20 to get 200 fmol in 11.5 µl - for library preparation with the Native Barcoding Kit from Oxford Nanopore. Use V1 = C2*V2 / C1, where V1 = x, C1 = DNA concentrations (ng/µl), C2 = 45.22 ng/µl, V2 = 11.5 µl). H20 volume = 11.5 µl - V1. These volumes will be used in the next step. Gel confirming amplification of ~4 kb amplicons Target concentration of library to normalise to 200 fmol based on a 4 kb amplicon . Example of a worksheet for calculating volumes (µl) of PCR products and H20 to get 200 fmol in 11.5 µl, required as input for each sample with the Native Barcoding Kit. C1 = DNA concentration (ng/µl), C2 (library concentration) = 45.22 ng/µl, V2 (target volume) = 11.5 µl.   3.4 Library preparation DNA Library preparation, including barcoding and pooling of samples (multiplexing). Here the DNA input are &gt;4 kb amplicons of the 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon from environmental DNA. The Long Fragment Buffer (LFB) is used (not the Short Fragment Buffer) Time required: ~ 6 hours from start to finished library ready for loading. Notes Follow the protocol Ligation sequencing amplicons - Native Barcoding Kit 96 V14 (SQK-NBD114.96)-minion.pdf available on nanoporetech.com. For details about the barcodes check here: https://community.nanoporetech.com/technical_documents/chemistry-technical-document/v/chtd_500_v1_revaq_07jul2016/barcode-sequences. For final library calculations we assume that around 300 bps are added to the amplicons through barcodes, flanking sequences and adapters. If you know more - let us know on the Github discussion section. Update the MinION packages and MinKNOW software. Prepare a sample sheet for upload to instrument if desired (not essential but saves a little time when setting up the sequencing in MinKNOW). More info on how to upload sample sheets here. Amplicon product yields from PCR can vary widely depending on environmental source. To achieve consistent, normalised concentrations (200 fmol) across all samples, add appropriate input volume (calculated with C1*V1 = C2*V2) and fill to 11.5 µl with H20 to the first step of the Native Barcoding kit protocol. If you plan to sequence after library preparations, insert a flow cell now and do a flow cell check and record the number of pores. This will take around 10 minutes. Afterwards store it at 4˚C until ready to load. We got 1,500-1,750 pores with new flowcells (R10.4.1) that were stored for two weeks at 4 degrees. 3.4.1 Checklist Native Barcoding Kit (Oxford Nanopore, SQK-NBD114.96) End-prep DNA Control Sample (DCS) Elution Buffer (EB) Native barcode ligation AMPure XP Beads (AXP) EDTA Native Barcodes (NB01-96) Sequencing adapter ligation Native Adapter (NA) Elution Buffer (EB) AMPure XP Beads (AXP) Long Fragment Buffer (LFB) NEBNext Quick Ligation Module (E6056, New England Biolab) NEBNext Ultra II End repair/dA-tailing Module (E7546S, New England Biolab) Blunt/TA Ligase Master Mix (M0367, New England Biolab) 80% ethanol, freshly prepared in nuclease-free water Nuclease-free water Qubit 1X dsDNA BR or HR Assay Kit (Q33266 or Q33231, Thermo Fisher) Eppendorf LoBind tubes (Eppendorf) Magnet for 1.5 ml tubes Hula mixer (#15920D, Thermo Fisher) or similar overhead mixers 3.4.2 Steps Follow the Nanopore protocol. There are four parts: End-prepping of 11.5 µL DNA (200 fmol). Pipetting into the 96-well plate may take time as there are two rounds of pipetting, one for the DNA amplicon volumes and one for H20 volumes to get 200 fmol amplicon DNA in 11.5 µl, as well as the remaining reagents for end-prepping the DNA. It is not possible to use multichannel pipettes for this step. Native barcode ligation using 0.75 µL of end-prepped DNA using one of 96 barcodes from the kit for each sample, plus pooling of all barcoded samples into a LoBind tube (1.5 mL). Bead clean-up of pooled end-prepped DNA library and elution of 35 µL volume; quantification with Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit. We used the all of the available end-prepped volume (e.g. 33 µl after Qubit quantification) for the next step, i.o. only 30 µl as per protocol. SAFE STOP: Store at 4 ˚C overnight if needed. Adapter ligation. Once this step is completed, you get a final volume of 15 µl of clean end-prepped/barcoded/adapter ligated DNA. We have stored the library at 4˚C overnight and sucessfully sequenced it the next day (although it is preferred to sequence right after adapter ligation). The concentration we achieved was ~20-25 ng/µl, which means there was sufficient DNA for two runs. After quantify DNA concentrations with 1 µl DNA there are 14 µl left. Nanopore’s recommended loading concentrations are 35–50 fmol at 12 µL volume. For example, at a concentration of 25.3 ng/µl (4,300 kb amplicon) a total of 5.50 µl of DNA library (plus 6.50 µl H20) are sufficient. The remaining 6.50 µl DNA library can be stored in fridge overnight if required. The Native Barcode Kit (SQK-NBD114.96) comes with 96 individual barcodes Bead clean-up of pooled end-prepped and adapter-ligated DNA library Calculation to get library volume for loading (In this example we used 5.52 µl of library, plus 6.48µl H20 for a final library volume of 12 µl at 50 fmol concentration) 3.5 Priming and loading of flow cell - run start Time required: ~10-15 mins for priming and loading. 24 hours for sequencing. 3.5.1 Checklist The same protocol: Ligation sequencing amplicons - Native Barcoding Kit 96 V14 (SQK-NBD114.96)-minion.pdf available on nanoporetech.com Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) (50 mg/ml) (AM2616, InvitrogenTM UltraPure) Native Barcoding Kit (Oxford Nanopore, SQK-NBD114.96) Flow Cell Flush (FCF) Flow Cell Tether (FCT) Sequencing Buffer (SB) Library Beads (LIB) R10.4.1 flowcell (Oxford Nanopore, FLO-MIN114) 3.5.2 Steps Follow the Nanopore protocol. There are five steps: Preparation and loading of sequencing buffer and wait for 5 minutes. Preparation of library. Nanopore’s protocol recommends loading 35–50 fmol at 12 µL volume. Loading of remaining sequencing buffer Loading of library Setting up the run for 24 hours and press start! More details will follow about recommended hours and expected yield based on 24 samples. 3.6 Flow cell wash Time required: ~ 1.5 hours. Wash the flow cell once the run has finished. Note that after the wash you can either load a new library directly afterwards or add storage buffer to load a new library later (always store flow at 4 ˚C). However, it is only possible to check the number of pores (and estimate potential yield) after adding storage buffer. The washing buffer is not suitable for a running a flow cell check. So loading a new library directly is only sensible if the user knows how many active pores to expect. Although, the instrument will do a pore scan at the start, it will be too late once you loaded the new library. As a gauge, we ran a flowcell with 1,500 pores for 24 hours (loaded with 24 barcoded samples of 16S-ITS-23S amplicons). At the end 558 active pores remained before the wash. Note that washing the flowcell does not interfer with any active basecalling processes on the Mk1C, which may take days to finish if High Accuracy was chosen. 3.6.1 Checklist Flow Cell Wash Kit (e.g. EXP-WSH004, Oxford Nanopore) Protocol Flow Cell Wash Kit (EXP-WSH004 or EXP-WSH004-XL)-minion.pdf available on nanopore.com 3.6.2 Steps Follow the Nanopore protocol. There are three steps: Preparation of 400 µl washing buffer Load 200 µl of washing buffer, wait 5 minutes, then add the remaining 200 µl and wait 1 hour. If you plan to store the flowcell for later use - add storage buffer. Otherwise load new library. 3.7 Basecalling Time required: ~ several days depending on computational resources.
