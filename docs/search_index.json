This GitBook provides a basic step-by-step protocol for students who want to get started with sequencing multiple samples of high quality, full-length microbial amplicons with an Oxford Nanopore instrument, and then process and visualise the data using various packages in R. This protocol reflects the experiences we had in the lab and may help to get you started on your own journey of discovery. One of the biggest hurdles for students that embark on sequencing environmental DNA for the first time, is the effort required to learn new technologies, various coding languages, file types and formats, packages or platforms that are involved (think Unix, Linux, Slurm, Qiime, R, RMarkdown, python, conda, ggplot, docker, GitHub, data instances…) before they even can start looking at exploring the data for biological meaning and producing publishable output. Hence, this protocol aims at lowering your ‘activation’ energy by providing some guidance for each step from DNA extraction, to amplification, library preparation, sequencing, data processing and finally some basic visualisations in R. This protocol uses the DNeasy Powersoil Pro Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to extract DNA from wastewater sludge, as well as the Native Barcoding Kit (SQK-NBD114.96) with a R10.4.1 flowcell (FLO-MIN114) to sequence long (~4-4.4 kb) amplicons from environmental DNA. The primer used was developed by (Martijn et al. 2019). Initial costs to purchase all consumables will be ~AUD$7,700. Check out our workflows for short-read 16S sequencing at https://chrismitbiz.github.io/ABlab-workflows if you want to get started with Miseq 16S sequencing instead. If you are interested in sequencing the living biomass via PMA treatment in combination with short-read 16S sequencing, check out our recent paper Dead in the water – Role of relic DNA and primer choice for targeted sequencing surveys of anaerobic sewage sludge intended for biological monitoring (Krohn et al. 2024) Get in touch We work at the Andy Ball lab, RMIT University, Bundoora, Melbourne and are part of the Industry-led Biosolids Training Centre.

In 2021 I joined the ARC Biosolids Training Centre at RMIT (www.transformingbiosolids.org.au), where we help water utilities to improve circular resource management by getting more renewable biogas and carbon/fertiliser values out of our municipal biosolids (essentially our poo). In project 1C of the Centre I develop metagenomic (DNA-based) methods to monitor the microbiome of anaerobic digestion, an important microbial treatment process for wastewater. I believe DNA-based diagnoses of wastewater sludges will help the water/biosolids sector improve resource recoveries and risk management. Before that, after a career in one of the most fast-cycled and short-sighted manufacturing industries that took me from Germany to Vietnam and Hong Kong/Shenzhen, I decided to hit the switch and start thinking long-term and circular. Ten back-to-uni years later, in 2021 I finished a PhD in Soil Science at La Trobe Uni where I sequenced soil DNA and explored if and how soil biology was involved in the degradation of extremely persistent legacy pesticides that contaminate agricultural surface soils since several decades.

Knowledge in shell scripting and Linux syntax. 2.2 DNA extraction kit We commonly extract DNA from soils or from wastewater sludges using the DNeasy Powersoil Pro Kit (Qiagen) for both, soil and sludge. It resulted in high quality DNA, suitable for library preparation and sequencing. Extraction with this kit includes a bead beating step to release DNA from cells out of difficult matrices such as soils and sludge (biofilms) or similar. The sheared DNA will be fragmented with a N50 of ~7 kb in some cases (Jensen et al. 2024). Shearing of DNA may be minimised by reducing/optimising bead-beating duration and speed.

Fragmentation of amplicons may lead to incomplete reads. The primer amplifies the whole rrn operon. Benefits of targeting the whole rrn operon: Superior species-level resolution and accuracy (Cuscó et al. 2019; Srinivas et al. 2024). Covers Bacteria and Archaea. Risks of targeting the whole rrn operon: Not as representative of true abundances as full-length 16S amplicons. Species with unlinked 16S and 23S rrn DNA will be missed with this approach (for example &lt; 9% of rRNA genes in wastewater sludge (Brewer et al. 2020)). 3.2.2 PCR Time required ~4 hrs incl. 2hrs, 40mins PCR. Prepare a mastermix for required number of 50 µl reactions (Table 3.1). Note that in our experience at least two 50 µl reactions are required to produce sufficient amplicon concentrations (200 fmol) for the Native Barcoding Kit from Oxford Nanopore. Add 3 µl of eDNA (5ng /µl) into a 96-well plate (e.g. Eppendorf twin.tec® PCR plate 96 LoBind, semi-skirted) using a multichannel pipette. Add 47 µl of mastermix using a multichannel pipette and carefully pipette up and down 10 x Run thermocycler (Table 3.2). Verify amplification length via 1% agarose gel electrophoresis @ 100V for 30 min including a 1 kb ladder. Store at 4˚C overnight if needed. Important: Use hot start polymerase for ease of use, with high fidelity/accuracy and one that is suitable for long amplicons. For example, Q5 High- Fidelity DNA Polymerase kit (New England Biolabs) with GC enhancer (Martijn et al. 2019). ≤ 200 fmol is required per sample for the Native Barcoding Kit from ONP. Based on 4.25 kb (4-4.5kb), the final DNA concentration after cleaning up PCR products should be no less than 48 ng/µL (at 11.5 µl input volume) - giving 552 ng of 4.25kb amplicons. It may require two–three PCR reactions to achieve the required DNA amount (200 fmol); e.g. pool 2–3 x 50µl PCR products, clean combined and elude in 32.5 µl Tris.     Table 3.1: List of components for each reaction (each tube) for PCR.

This follows a similar protocol to the Illumina 16S-metagenomics library prep guide. Time required ~ 1 hr per 24 samples. 3.3.1 Checklist Magnet for 96-well plate 80% ethanol, freshly prepared in nuclease-free water Nuclease-free water 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 with 50 mM NaCl (UltraPure™ 1M Tris-HCI, pH 8.0 #15568025 &amp; NaCl (5 M), RNase-free #AM9760G, Thermo Fisher) JetSeq Clean Magnetic beads (MER-BIO-68031, Millenium Science) or equivalent - to clean up PCR products. Notes Use wide bore tips for adding mag beads and subsequent (careful) mixing by pipetting to minimise DNA fragmentation. 3.3.2 Steps Pool replicate reactions into one well - e.g. 3 x 50 µl = 150 µl in one well. Using a multi channel pipette, add 0.6X beads to PCR products in the same wells (e.g. 90 µl to 150 µl pooled reactions), pipette 10 x up and down and/or a gentle vortex after sealing the plate, careful not to spill (Vortex Genie speed 2). 10 min incubation at RT Place 5 mins on 96-well magnet and remove supernatant. Wash twice with 200 µl 80% OH in same 96-well plate and let alcohol evaporate for ~ 5 mins or until alcohol is completely removed. Take plate off magnet and elude pellet to a volume that provides appropriate DNA concentrations e.g. add 32.5 µl of elution buffer (10 mM Tris 50mM NaCl). The pellet will be stuck higher than the buffer surface in the well. Hence, pipetting up and down 20–30 x may be necessary to carefully wash the pellet of the tube wall, using a wide bore tip. Or centrifuge plate at 200-500 rcf for 1 min. Off-magnet, incubate in final elution (incl. beads) for 15 minutes at 37°C. Every 2 minutes, agitate the sample by gently vortexing the plate for 10 seconds (after sealing plate) to encourage DNA elution. Collect 30 µl of cleaned DNA after ~ 5 mins on magnet using wide bore tips. Quantify and record amplicon concentrations using Qubit HS or BS chemistry and record values. Based on 4.25 kb amplicons (4-4.5kb), the final DNA concentration after cleaning up PCR products should be no less than 48 ng/µL to have sufficient material for downstream library preparation (200 fmol, &gt; 552 ng of 4.25kb amplicons). Verify amplification length via 1% agarose gel electrophoresis @ 100V for 30 min including a 1 kb ladder. For each sample calculate volumes required of cleaned DNA and H20 to get 200 fmol in 11.5 µl - for library preparation with the Native Barcoding Kit from Oxford Nanopore. Use V1 = C2*V2 / C1, where V1 = x, C1 = DNA concentrations (ng/µl), C2 = 48 ng/µl, V2 = 11.5 µl). H20 volume = 11.5 µl - V1. These volumes will be used in the next step. 3.4 Library preparation DNA Library preparation, including multiplexing and pooling of different samples. Here the 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon was amplified from environmental DNA during PCR. Notes Follow the protocol Native Barcoding Kit 96 V14 (SQK-NBD114.96) from Oxford Nanopore. Update the MinION packages and MinKNOW software. Prepare a sample sheet for upload to instrument (to save time when setting up the sequencing in MinKNOW) Check and record which basecaller is used in the most recent MINKNOW software update. Should be Dorado. Print out and follow the Kit’s protocol and checklist (Ligation sequencing amplicons - Native Barcoding Kit 96 V14 (SQK-NBD114.96)-minion.pdf). Amplicon product yields from PCR can vary widely depending on environmental source. To achieve consistent (normalised) concentrations (200 fmol) across all samples, add appropriate input volume (calculated with C1V1 = C2V2) and fill to 11.5 µl with H20 to the first step of the Native Barcoding kit protocol (‘Ligation sequencing amplicons - Native Barcoding Kit 96 V14 (SQK-NBD114.96)-minion.pdf’. If concentration was lower than the required 200 fmol for a sample, the input volume of the end-prepped amplicons into the second step of the protocol (native barcode ligation step) may have to be increased accordingly. 3.4.1 Outline of steps End-prep DNA of 11.5 µL DNA (200 fmol). Native barcode ligation using 0.75 µL of end-prepped DNA using one of 96 barcodes from the kit incl. pooling of barcoded samples into LoBind tube (1.5 mL). Bead clean-up and elution of 35 µL of pooled library and Qubit. SAFE STOP: store at 4 ˚C overnight if needed. Adapter ligation to get a final library of 35–50 fmol at 12 µL.
