# A protocol for sequencing and analysing 16S-ITS-23S amplicons using Oxford Nanopore’s Native Barcoding kit to profile prokaryotes on species-level in a mixed community [Under development]

Welcome! 

This GitBook provides a basic step-by-step protocol for students who want to get started with sequencing multiple samples of high quality, full-length microbial amplicons with an Oxford Nanopore instrument, and then process and visualise the data using various packages in R.

Check out our workflows for short-read 16S sequencing at [https://chrismitbiz.github.io/ABlab-workflows](https://chrismitbiz.github.io/ABlab-workflows) if you want to get started with Miseq 16S sequencing instead.  

If you are interested in sequencing the living biomass via PMA treatment in combination with short-read 16S sequencing, check out our recent paper [Dead in the water – Role of relic DNA and primer choice for targeted sequencing surveys of anaerobic sewage sludge intended for biological monitoring](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2024.121354).
